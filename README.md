Kakoi is an open-source enclosure for the Rainkeebs Yasui 40% ortholinear keyboard. This project was designed to allow for a simple & cheap acrylic case to be fabricated which results in minmal waste.

## Key Dimensions:
- yasui: 190x76mm
- kakoi: 210x96mm

## Fabrication Info:
![Kakoi Pieces](images/layout_diagram.png)
- Depending on the thickness of the material you intend to use, you may need to only need to cut 2-4 layers of the split middle plate. For this layer, you will need to pack the individual pieces depending on the number of layers you require - the enclosure has been designed to optimise this and reduce wasted space.
- The salmon coloured pieces in the above diagram are identical, so make sure you cut double the number of this piece as the rest.
- You only need to cut the bottom plate once.
- There is no top plate, as this is a drop-in enclosure.

Note: The SVG file provided is merely the "blueprint" for the enclosure, you will need to convert this to a suitable format for the service/hardware responsible for cutting your materials. There is a basic fabrication template for RazorLab - following their specific guidlines.

Enjoy!
