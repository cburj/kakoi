# Kakoi

Kakoi is an open-source enclosure for the Rainkeebs Yasui 40% ortholinear keyboard. This project was designed to allow for a simple & cheap acrylic case to be fabricated and result in minmal waste.

Key Dimensions:
- yasui: 190x76mm
- kakoi: 210x96mm

Depending on the thickness of the material you intend to use, you may need to only need to cut 2-4 layers of the split middle plate.

Note: This file is merely the "blueprint" for the enclosure, you will need to convert this to a suitable format for the service/hardware responsible for cutting your materials.

Enjoy!
